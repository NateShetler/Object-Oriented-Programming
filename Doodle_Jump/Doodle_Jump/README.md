# Milestone 2

This is doodle jump after I moved all of the code out of main and into 
different files. I created a point class and a game class. All of the 
game logic is within the game class and is split up into different 
functions based on what it does. This makes the game logic easier to 
follow. The game is played within the playGame function. This function
also calls all of the other game functions to make the game work.
